# What do the Heating and Cooling Loads of Residential Buildings depend on?

In this analysis, we study the influence of eight predictor variables, namely **Relative Compactness, Surface Area, Wall Area, Roof Area, Overall Height, Orientation, Glazing Area, and Glazing Area Distribution** on Heating and Cooling Loads of 768 diverse residential buildings.

Models are trained on 80% of the available data and validated on the remaining 20% to avoid overfitting. 
The model building approaches considered include:

* [Linear Regression](linear-regression)
  * [Multivariation Linear Regression](multivariate-linear-regression)
  * [Crossvalidated Linear Regression](crossvalidated-linear-regression)
* [Feature Extraction](feature-extraction)
  * [Stepwise Linear Regression](stepwise-linear-regression)
  * [Principal Component Analysis](principal-component-analysis)
  * [Lasso Regression](lasso-regression)
 * [Classification and Regression Trees](classification-and-regression-trees)
 * [Random Forests](random-forests)
 
 Let's begin my previewing the data.
