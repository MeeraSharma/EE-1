# What do the Heating and Cooling Loads of Residential Buildings depend on?

In this analysis, we study the influence of eight predictor variables, namely:

* Relative Compactness,
* Surface Area,
* Wall Area,
* Roof Area,
* Overall Height,
* Orientation,
* Glazing Area, and
* Glazing Area Distribution

on Heating and Cooling Loads of 768 diverse residential buildings.

First, we train the models on 80% of the available data and then, perform model validation on the remaining 20% of the data. 
Various approaches are used to build a refined model, starting with classical approaches and building up to state-of-the-art nonlinear non-parametric methods. The approaches covered are:

* Multivariate Linear Regression
* Stepwise Linear Regression
* Feature Extraction using Principal Component Analysis and Lasso Regression, followed by Regression 
* Classification and Regression Trees
* Random Forests
